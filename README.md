# Arkitect ![Arkitect](https://github.com/phparkitect/arkitect/workflows/Arkitect/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Goal

 - Check strong architecture rules and fail on CI
 - Check architecture rules and show warnings (for architectural migrations)

## Principles

 - A great Developer eXperience (IDE autocomplete is crucial)
 - Code style is out of scope
 - No new rules without a good real example

## Examples of rules that can be enforced

 - dependency between namespaces
 - naming of classes
 - should implement interface
